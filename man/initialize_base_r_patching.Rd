\title{Initialize Base R function patching}
\usage{
initialize_base_r_patching(include_low = TRUE, include_layout = TRUE)

\item{include_layout}{Include LAYOUT functions (par, layout, etc.)}
}
\value{

\description{
This function sets up the function patching system by wrapping Base R
plotting functions (HIGH, LOW, and LAYOUT levels).
It should be called before any Base R plotting commands.
}
\details{
Wrappers are installed once into the package namespace during .onLoad
(when the namespace is still open). Subsequent calls just activate the
patching flag; wrappers check this flag to decide whether to record calls
or simply pass through to the original function.
