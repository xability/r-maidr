Description: Provides accessible, interactive visualizations through the MAIDR
    (Multimodal Access and Interactive Data Representation) system. Converts
    ggplot2 and Base R plots into accessible HTML/SVG formats with keyboard
    navigation, screen reader support, and sonification capabilities. Supports
    bar charts (simple, grouped, stacked), histograms, line plots, scatter plots,
    box plots, heat maps, density/smooth curves, faceted plots, multi-panel
    layouts (including patchwork), and multi-layered plot combinations. Enables
    data exploration for users with visual impairments through multiple sensory
    modalities.
